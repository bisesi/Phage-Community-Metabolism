Plasmidsaurus sequencing data for all strains and plasmids of interest. 

Both versions of the F plasmid (F128 and pOX38) were sequenced as part of a bacterial genome (F128 with the original MG1655 donor, pOX38 with E0224), thus consist of both a bacterial and a plasmid contig (with the potential for some genes to be mis-assigned to one contig or the other). 

Only plasmids were sequenced for JS002 and M13, so no bacterial genes should be present.

Fastq files are available in each folder for all MGE strains, along with Plasmidsaurus annotations.

NCBI reference genomes corresponding to the three MGEs of interest (F128, pOX38, M13) are available in ncbi-genomes.
